# [3.0.0](https://github.com/ksalzke/defer-tag-omnifocus-plugin/compare/v2.4.0...v3.0.0) (2021-10-18)


* Use dropped folder for storage of scheduler tasks (#3) ([8916bc9](https://github.com/ksalzke/defer-tag-omnifocus-plugin/commit/8916bc94adbebed99c598b5cbfb78904f02b5d00)), closes [#3](https://github.com/ksalzke/defer-tag-omnifocus-plugin/issues/3)


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Previously project matching 'Tag Scheduling' was used to store scheduler tasks.
These are now stored in a 'üè∑ Tag Scheduling' project inside a dropped folder of same name.
The project is created automatically when needed.
This avoids cluttering other views but existing deferred tags may need to be moved manually.
