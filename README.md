# Actions

## Defer Tasks With Tag

This action shows a form prompting the user to select a tag and enter a defer date. 

Then, for each task with the selected tag or any subtags of the selected tag, it checks the defer date and:
1. If the existing defer date is after the entered defer date, no change is made.
2. Otherwise, the task's defer date is set to the entered date.
